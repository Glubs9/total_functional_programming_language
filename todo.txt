3. general testing, definitely around splitting and the such
4. see if you can get that logic programming idea sorted
5. check destroy doesn't exist in any primitive function
6. ml esque algebra
	1. lexer defined like this data n = name1[type,type,...] | name2[type,type,...] | ...; 
7. fix recursion to be structural recursion
	- introduce back the previous checkers except make sure that all calls that are recursive in
	nature use structural recursion. Don't need to run it calling other functions
	- also check that the only time a recursive function is called is when it is being
	structurally recursed
