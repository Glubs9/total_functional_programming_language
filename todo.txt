4. see if you can get that logic programming idea sorted
5. check destroy doesn't exist in any primitive function
7. RE ADD SEMANTICS CHECKING ITS CURRENTLY DISABLSED
	a. check that data constructors are unique
	b. check that data constructors do not embed themselves
	c. update to handle data with longer arities
8. optimize semantics checker so it only runs analysis once and uses that analysi sa whole bunch
	a. maybe, think about it later.
