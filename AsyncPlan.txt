detect when a non-primitive is called in a primititve scope
	- we need to write a scope class with this info probably
when they are create a new scope where bottom value is returned
	- continue normal execution for prev scope, with added relationships to the other scope
before pushing non-prim push to call stack for the deletion of the bottom scope
	- when deleting adjust all references that exisst in the scope list

for main run function
	- we cycle through the stack list executing one at a time,
		- need to check we can't get caught in a loop of ever increasing list

NOTE: I would love to have this as a separated part of the code but it doesn't seem reasonable to do
so
	- maybe in the scope class as a separate file

also for total function we need to write a thing that when a total function is called with bottom
then it works as id.
	- we needt to allow them to manually handle bottom if we want, what symbol do we use?
		- i'm inclined toward !
